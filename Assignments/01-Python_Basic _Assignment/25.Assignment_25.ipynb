    "**Ans**: An `iterators` is object which contains a countable number of values and it is used to iterate over iterable objects like list, tuple sets. Iterators are implemented using a class. It follow lazy evaluation where the evaluation of the expression will be on hold and stored in the memory until the item is called specifically which helps us to avoid repeated evaluation. As lazy is implemented it requires only 1 memory location to process the value and when we are using a large dataset then, wastage of RAM space will be reduced the need to load the entire dataset at same time will not be there.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Generators` are an another way to creating iterators in a simple way where it uses the keyword `yield` statement instead of `return` statement in a defined function. Generators are implemented using a function returns the data without affecting or existing the function. It will return a sequence of data in an iterable format where we need to iterate over the seqence to use the data as they won't store the entire sequence in the memory"

This allows its code to produce a series of values of values over time, rather than computing them at once and sending them back like a list. "
